'''
Given:
 An array(list) of non-negative digits that represent a decimal integer.
 
 
Problem:
 Add one to the integer. Assume the solution still works even if implemented in a language with finite-precision arithmetic.

Example:
    [1, 4, 9] + 1 = [1,5,0]
'''

num = "149"
num = [int(i) for i in num]
