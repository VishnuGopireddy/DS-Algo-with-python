'''
An efficient solution is to use Euclidean algorithm which is the main algorithm used for this purpose.
The idea is, GCD of two numbers doesnâ€™t change if smaller number is subtracted from a bigger number.

def gcd(a,b):
    if a == 0:
        return b
    if b == 0:
        return a
    if a == b:
        return a
    else:
        if a > b:
            return gcd(a-b,b)
        else:
            return gcd(a,b-a)
