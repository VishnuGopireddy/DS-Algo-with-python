#Find the longest increasing subsequence
'''
Example: [2,10,13,15,3,11,12]
longestincreasing subsequences are: [2,3,11,12], [2,10,13,15], [10,13,15]
Approach1:
    arr = [2,10,13,15,3,11,12]
    arr1 = [2,3,10,11,12,13,15] ==> sorted array
    Perform Longest common subsequence on arr, arr1
    TIME and Space = O(n^2)
Approach 2:
